# Sri Lankan Traffic Sign Dataset

This dataset was created for our final year project "Advance Driver Assistant System". it includes more than 11800 images with 17 classes. For 0 to 7 classes we got images from other countries' datasets. Because speed signs are the same in almost every country. For 8 to 16 classes we use images from https://github.com/saranki/road-sign-board-detection-dataset-sri-lanka. The dataset includes colored 32 x 32 images and labels.csv file.
